<h1>About me</h1>

    <p>I'm Philemond, usually go by Phil. A swede who recently moved to UK and am trying to find my way in a new country. <br />
    While it might be assumed that I should keep busy with getting comfortable in this new country, <br />
    I find myself trying to learn how to become a web developer so that I can switch careers. <br />
    I'm hoping to have time to be more active outside once summer rolls around, it's the best season anyway! <br /><br />

    In my sparetime I stay moderatively active with either walking or going to the gym, I'm hoping to get into running in the near future! <br />
    Nature is something I hold dear and am hoping to be able to get out of the city more once spring and summer comes around to <br />explore the beautiful nature that this country has to offer. <br /> <br />

    I also enjoy music, video games and movies a lot. I'm a sucker for singer songwriters. <br />
    I've been completely losing myself in Hozier's music for the past year or so, HE'S AMAZING! <br />
